        "description": "Biological physics, or the physics of living systems, has emerged fully as a field of physics, alongside more traditional fields of astrophysics and cosmology, atomic, molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, particle physics, and plasma physics. This new field brings the physicist's style of inquiry to bear on the beautiful phenomena of life. The enormous range of phenomena encountered in living systems - phenomena that often have no analog or precedent in the inanimate world - means that the intellectual agenda of biological physics is exceptionally broad, even by the ambitious standards of physics.",

Rather, scientists from various backgrounds, ranging from fundamental physics and chemistry to the (bio) applied sciences, have joined their efforts in order to make this new era of 'high-tech' biotechnology possible.In the present volume of 'Focus on Biotechnology', a selected group of distinguished experts describe how their field succeeded in developing the new frontiers of biotechnology. The physical or chemical underlying principles form the core of each chapter, which ends with a sketch of anticipated developments during the next decade.Audience: Any self-respecting scientist who aims to implement his work within the framework of practical applications will find 'Focus on Biotechnology - Physics and Chemistry basis Biotechnology' a must-have volume.",

        "description": "While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.",
